In an open circuit test, all current flows through Rc and Xm. Winding resistance and reactance are negligible compared to Rc and Xm. First, cosQ is found using the formula P = V * I * cosQ.
Then, Im and Ic are calculated using the formulas Ic = Io.cosQ and Im = Io.sinQ.
Finally, since the voltage across the elements is V1,

Rc = V1/Ic and Xm = V1/Im are used to find the values ​​of Rc and Xm.
Finally, since X = jwL, the value of L is found using L = Xm/w.
