# Single-Phase Transformer  
## Open Circuit Test (Theory & Calculations)

## 1. Introduction
The open circuit (no-load) test is performed on a single-phase transformer to determine
the **core loss resistance** and **magnetizing reactance**.  
In this test, the secondary winding is kept open while the rated voltage is applied
to the primary winding.

---

## 2. Assumptions
- The no-load current is very small.
- The entire current flows through the core branch.
- Winding resistance and leakage reactance are negligible compared to
  core loss resistance and magnetizing reactance.

## 3. Power Factor Calculation
The input power measured during the test is given by:

$$
P = V I \cos\varphi
$$

From this equation, the power factor is obtained as:

$$
\cos\varphi = \frac{P}{V I}
$$

## 4. No-Load Current Components
The no-load current $I_0$ is resolved into two components:

### Core Loss (Active) Current
$$
I_c = I_0 \cos\varphi
$$

### Magnetizing Current
$$
I_m = I_0 \sin\varphi
$$

---

## 5. Core Branch Parameters
Since the voltage across the core branch is equal to the applied primary voltage $V_1$,
the core parameters are calculated as follows:

### Core Loss Resistance
$$
R_c = \frac{V_1}{I_c}
$$

### Magnetizing Reactance
$$
X_m = \frac{V_1}{I_m}
$$

## 6. Magnetizing Inductance
The magnetizing reactance is related to the inductance by:

$$
X_m = \omega L
$$

Therefore, the magnetizing inductance is:

$$
L = \frac{X_m}{\omega}
$$

where

$$
\omega = 2\pi f
$$

and $f$ is the supply frequency.

## 7. Conclusion
The open circuit test provides an effective method to determine the transformer
core parameters without loading the transformer. These parameters are essential
for accurate equivalent circuit modeling and performance analysis.
