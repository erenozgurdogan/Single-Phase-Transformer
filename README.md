# STM32-Based High-Gain Quadratic DC–DC Boost Converter

In this project, open-circuit and short-circuit tests were conducted on a 50 kVA, 220/2200 V transformer with parameters 
𝑅𝑐=1.0804×106 and 𝑋𝑚=2886Xm=2886.
As a result of the short-circuit test, the core resistance and magnetizing reactance values were obtained.
