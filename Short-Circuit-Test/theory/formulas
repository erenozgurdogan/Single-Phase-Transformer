Short-circuit test: Since the core resistance 
𝑅𝑐 and the magnetizing reactance 𝑋𝑚 are very large compared to the winding resistance and winding reactance, they draw a very small current. 
Therefore, they can be neglected. The equivalent impedance is calculated as
𝑍𝑒𝑞=𝑉𝑠𝑐*𝐼𝑠
Then,

𝑅𝑒𝑞=𝑍𝑒𝑞*cos⁡𝜙  and 𝑋𝑒𝑞=𝑍𝑒𝑞*sin⁡𝜙

are calculated.
